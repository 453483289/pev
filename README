1. What is pev

 pev is a PE file analysis toolkit that includes some
 nice programs to work with PE files in non-Windows
 systems. It can be useful for programmers, security
 analysts and forensic investigators. It's licensed
 under GPLv3+ terms.

2. OS support

 This version is tested in Linux, x86 and x86-64
 and OSX systems. If you're running pev tools
 sucessfully in other environments, please let
 us know.

3. Installing

 3.1. Installing all tools

  To compile and install libpe and all pev tools, do the
  following:

  $ ./configure
  $ make
  # make install

  Additionally, you can set a prefix dir by running:

  $ ./configure --prefix=/usr

  Note that libpe will be installed under prefix
  directory too. So you need to ensure that
  PREFIX/lib is in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment
  variable before execute of pev programs.

 3.2. Building libpe only

  To build only libpe, go to lib/libpe dir and
  use the Makefile provided:

  $ cd lib/libpe
  $ make
  # make install

  Check PREFIX and DEST variables in Makefile if
  you think you need.

 3.3. Building a particular tool

  If you want to build a particular tool, you
  can use the Makefile in src/ dir:

  $ cd src/
  $ make pesec

  The commmand above will build only pesec binary.

4. Included programs

 This pev toolkit version include:

 * readpe   - show PE file headers
 * pedis    - PE disassembler
 * pesec    - check security features in PE files
 * petls    - find TLS callbacks in PE files
 * rva2ofs  - convert RVA to raw file offsets
 * ofs2rva  - convert raw file offsets to RVA
 * packid   - generic packer detector
