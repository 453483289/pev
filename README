1. What is pev

 pev is a PE file analysis toolkit that includes some
 nice programs to work with PE files in many systems
 It can be useful for programmers, security analysts
 and forensic investigators. It's licensed  under
 GPLv3+ terms.

2. OS support

 This version is tested in Linux (x86 and x86-64),
 OSX systems and Windows under Cygwin (http://www.cygwin.com).
 If you'rerunning pev tools sucessfully in other environments,
 please let  us know.

3. Pre-requisites

 libssl (pehash only)
 libpcre (pestr only)
 libc
 gcc
 make

4. Building and installing

 4.1. Installing all tools (Linux and OS X)

  To compile and install libpe and all pev tools:

  $ make
  # make install

 4.2. Building libpe only

  To build only libpe, go to lib/libpe dir and
  use the Makefile provided:

  $ cd lib/libpe
  $ make
  # make install

  Set PREFIX and/or DEST if needed.

 4.3. Building a particular tool

  If you want to build a particular tool, you
  can use the Makefile in src/ dir:

  $ cd src/
  $ make pesec

  The commmand above will build only pesec binary
  but *you need to compile libpe first* (section 4.2).

 4.4. Building in Windows (via Cygwin)

  Under Cygwin, you'll need following packages
  in order to compile pev:

  * gcc
  * binutils
  * make
  * libpcre-dev (pestr)
  * openssl-devel (pehash)
  * zip

  Compile with:

  $ make

  Build a zip package with all tools and required libraries with:

  $ make zip

  You can't call another targets (like make install)
  in Cygwin environment.

5. Included tools

 * pehash   - calculate PE file hashes
 * pedis    - PE disassembler
 * pepack   - packer detector
 * pescan   - search for suspicious things in PE files, including TLS callbacks
 * pesec    - check security features in PE files
 * pestr    - search for unicode and ascii strings in PE files
 * readpe   - show PE file headers, sections and more
 * rva2ofs  - convert RVA to raw file offsets
 * ofs2rva  - convert raw file offsets to RVA
