pev is available under the GPLv3+ license, see the LICENSE for details.

Compiling
---------

Compiling pev is generally quite simple. pev currently depends only
on libc6 >= 2.11.

Many distributions already have packages that satisify these.

Compile pev is as simple as:

$ make

If you want a clean compilation (already compiled before), run:

$ make clean && make


Installing
----------

Basic installation is simple, you may run:

$ sudo make install


Uninstalling
------------------

To uninstall pev, run:

$ sudo make uninstall


Using
------------------

pev can display a lot of information about PE files. Please, refer
to manpage to more information.

To see all info that pev can retrieve, just run it without any
arguments against a PE32 executable:

$ pev ~/.wine/drive_c/windows/system32/cards.dll

You can check the syntax with:
$ pev --help
or
$ man pev
