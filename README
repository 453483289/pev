1. What is pev

 pev is a PE file analysis toolkit that includes some
 nice programs to work with PE files in many systems
 It can be useful for programmers, security analysts
 and forensic investigators. It's licensed  under
 GPLv3+ terms.

2. OS support

 This version is tested in Linux (x86 and x86-64),
 OSX systems and Windows under Cygwin (http://www.cygwin.com).
 If you'rerunning pev tools sucessfully in other environments,
 please let  us know.

3. Pre-requisites

 libssl >= 1.0.0 (pehash only)
 libc >= 2.10
 gcc >= 4.5.0
 make
 sed (for configure script)

4. Building and installing

 4.1. Installing all tools (Linux and OSX)

  To compile and install libpe and all pev tools, do the
  following:

  $ ./configure
  $ make
  # make install

  Additionally, you can set a prefix dir by running:

  $ ./configure --prefix=/usr

  Note that libpe will be installed under prefix
  directory too. So you need to ensure that
  PREFIX/lib is in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment
  variable before running pev tools.

 4.2. Building libpe only

  To build only libpe, go to lib/libpe dir and
  use the Makefile provided:

  $ cd lib/libpe
  $ make
  # make install

  Check PREFIX and DEST variables in Makefile if
  you think you need.

 4.3. Building a particular tool

  If you want to build a particular tool, you
  can use the Makefile in src/ dir:

  $ cd src/
  $ make pesec

  The commmand above will build only pesec binary.

 4.4. Building in Windows (via Cygwin)

  Under Cygwin, you'll need following packages
  in order to compile pev:

  * i686-pc-mingw32-gcc.exe (32-bit system)
  * x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc (64-bit system)
  * binutils
  * mingw-binutils
  * make
  * sed
  * zip

  Compile with:

  $ ./configure
  $ make

  Build a zip package with libpe.dll and all tools:

  $ make zip

  You can't call other make targets (like make install)
  in Cygwin environment.

5. Included tools

 * pehash   - calculate PE file hashes
 * pedis    - PE disassembler
 * pepack   - packer detector
 * pescan   - search for suspicious things in PE files, including TLS callbacks
 * pesec    - check security features in PE files
 * pestr    - search for unicode and ascii strings in PE files
 * readpe   - show PE file headers, sections and more
 * rva2ofs  - convert RVA to raw file offsets
 * ofs2rva  - convert raw file offsets to RVA
